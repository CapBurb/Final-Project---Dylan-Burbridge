For my final project, I decided to emulate a very simple blackjack game that has the player face against the House (Computer)

Upon opening the code, the user will be greated with a text banner and dealt two cards. The house will also be dealt two cards.
The user will see a short prompt at the first code opening that explains the rules of blackjack, as well as how the game translates into the coded emulator

The value of these cards is calculated for the users conveniase, and for those who have not played blackjack before this can be a great help. The same is true of the houses cards.

During the game, the user will have only two inputs "hit" or "stay" as these are the only actions that can be taken.

The game will show a player the end value of their cards compared to the houses cards and display if they won, lost or tied.

To simulate a "bet" the user will gain 100 chips each round they win, and lose 75 chips each round they loose. The goal of the game is to get as many chips as possible before you can "cash out" and end your game

Once your game is ended, you can see your score on a list of highscores.

Have fun and good luck in coding Vegas!
