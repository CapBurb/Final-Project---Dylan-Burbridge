For my final project, I decided to emulate a straightforward blackjack game that has the player face against the House (Computer)

Upon opening the code, the user will be greeted with a text banner and dealt two cards. 

The value of these cards is calculated for the user's convenience, which can be very helpful for those who have not played blackjack before. 
The same is true of the house cards. During the game, the user will have only two inputs "hit" or "stay" as these are the only actions that can be taken.

The game will show a player the end value of their cards compared to the house's cards and display whether they won, lost, or tied.

To simulate a "bet" the user will gain 100 chips each round they win, and lose 75 chips each round they lose. 
The goal of the game is to get as many chips as possible before you can "cash out" and end your game. 
Once your game has ended, you can see your score on a list of high scores.

Have fun and good luck in coding Vegas!
